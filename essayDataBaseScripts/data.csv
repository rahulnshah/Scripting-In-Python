Disadvantages_of_Internet_of_Things,2593,3,"﻿1  Disadvantages of Internet of Things   Rahul N. Shah   Department of Humanities, New Jersey Institute of Technology HUM102: Writing, Speaking, Thinking II   Robert J. Platt, M.A.   May 7, 2021  2  Abstract   The Internet of Things is a broad term that refers to a group of devices that exchange  information with other devices in a local network. The term could also be used to describe one  automatic device that adjust itself to our needs. While IoT technology does accelerate our daily  tasks, it can also potentially work to our disadvantage. This paper will drive deep into two main  issues facing IoT and those are security and compatibility. Security and structural compatibility  are two things the all IoT devices do not guarantee and as we see in this paper, the consequences  of using unsecure or malfunctioning Wi-Fi-enabled devices can be costly to users who rely on  them.  This paper argues that IoT technology is flawed because it violates our privacy and has been  reasonably proven to function improperly.  Keywords: Internet, technology, wi-fi, automation 3  Background Information   The internet of things (IoT) describes an interconnected web of electronic devices or any  physical device connected to the internet by a wireless protocol such as Wi-Fi, that optimizes its  sensor data in order to automate tasks (Burgess, 2018). Sensor data in IoT devices could also be  extracted for relevant use. Hilti, which manufactures construction equipment, for example,  developed an HCS wireless concrete sensor that can gauge a concrete’s temperature, maturity,  and even humidity (Concrete Sensors, para. 2).  Despite its applications and ease of use, the Internet of Things is an imperfect technology  because IoT devices are not fully secure and have shown vulnerability to data breaches and not  all devices on an IoT network run on the same cloud platform or are built to be compatible with  each other, meaning it is harder for the devices to transfer data among them (Burgess, 2018).  The paper will elaborate on these disadvantages in more depth and present current viable  solutions to these problems.   Rationale   One of the disadvantages to using IoT devices is that some of them are easily hackable (Burgess, 2018), which poses a threat to a user’s privacy. In 2015, security researchers Charlie  Miller and Chris Valasek remotely took control of their own Jeep Cherokee’s transmission,  radio, air conditioning and even its steering system. They did this not only to abide the law but more importantly, to demonstrate potential attacks made by cybercriminals on an automobile’s  driving capabilities. In order to prevent further hacking of their vehicles, Chrysler recalled 1.4  million of their vehicles to apply a “software patch” to the Jeep’s radio, through which the two  hackers initially took control of the car’s various operating systems (Fiat Chrysler recalls 1.4m  vehicles in wake of Jeep hacking revelation, 2015). About six years ago, another U.S. security  4  researcher, Matt Jakubowski discovered how Mattel’s wireless Hello Barbie Doll could be easily  hacked and manipulated to work as a surveillance device for spying on children without his/her  parent’s consent.   When connected to Wi-Fi, a hacker could easily intersect the doll’s “system information  [and] account information” (Gibbs, 2015) along with audio recordings of a child’s conversations  with the doll and from there, “…gain access to other internet connected devices, steal personal  information, and cause other problems for the owners, potentially without their knowledge”  (Gibbs, 2015). Like many other voice recognition technologies, Mattel’s wireless Hello Barbie  Doll sent recordings of children to a third-party company called ToyTalk. According to  ToyTalk’s privacy policy, it also forwarded the audio recordings to other third parties to improve  the doll’s speech recognition ability and used the recordings to enable the doll to generate an  appropriate response to the children. Even before Jakubowski made his investigation, privacy  advocates such as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood organization elicited  concerns on privacy that the doll failed to provide to its users (Gibbs, 2015).   Besides being characterized as an unsecure technology, a IoT network can also fail to  function properly if all IoT devices in that network are not standardized. IoT devices can  communicate with each other through a variety of wireless protocols such as standard Wi-Fi,  Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and Long-Term Evolution for  Machines (LTE-M). However, different IoT devices running on different wireless protocols  lessens connectivity among them and thus, they cannot concisely share and communicate sensor  data with each other. In addition to having a myriad of wireless protocols in place, “...nonunified  cloud services, lack of standardized M2M protocols and diversities in firmware and operating  5  systems among IoT devices” (Banafa, 2017. para. 11) also give rise to compatibility issues.  Machine-to-Machine (M2M) protocols are used to establish communication between any two  wired or wireless devices in an IoT network (Balaji et al., 2019). Moreover, cloud computing  services take care of massive amounts of data generated by IoT devices, allow the devices to  share the information with another device at a fast pace, and provide scalable information storage  capacity to IoT users, without them having to install an on-premises infrastructure (Banafa, 2017.  para. 11). Therefore, there is a greater need for compatibility among IoT devices, especially for  businesses which analyze data through IoT on their customers’ interactions with their product or  service. According to (Burgess, 2018), Microsoft launched a standardized IoT service in 2017  called IoT Central that consolidated technology from existing cloud infrastructures to help  companies analyze their data. Furthermore, it eliminated the use of other cloud solutions or the  knowledge of them that had previously caused compatibility issues along with some architectural  components-consisting of hardware and software-in business IoT applications.  Limitations   Though this proposal is derived from extensive research, it is by no means sufficient  enough to outweigh the advantages of IoT by its disadvantages. This is because it does not cover  problems arising in all applications of IoT, such as agricultural, industrial, and even the medical  field. On the other hand, (Balaji et al. 2019) further discuss the application of IoT in each of  these areas.  6  Annotated Bibliography   Balaji, S., Nathani, K. & Santhakumar, R.

The content of this newsletter will be used to support the fact that an IoT network has  some compatibility issues which impedes its ability to function as one whole unit. As  (Banafa, 2017) argues, compatibility issues occur due to a lack a standardization in the IoT  network. Standardization is needed in wireless protocols, cloud infrastructure, and  firmware in order to establish connectivity within the network.   Burgress, M. (2015, March 13).

Jeep owners urged to update their cars after hackers take remote  control. The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/21/jeep ownersurged-update-car-software-hackers-remote-control   This article by The Guardian writer Samuel Gibbs explains how commonly used IoT  devices, that we often underestimate to be any harmful, can be used against us. Security  professionals Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek showed that Fiat Jeep’s operating systems could  remotely be manipulated and put the driver’s life at risk from car collisions. They specifically  were able to tap into the car’s transmission, radio, air conditioning, and steering system.   This article will be used to support the claim that IoT devices are not fully secure against  security and privacy breaches.   Gibbs, S. (2015, November 26).

Privacy fears over 'smart' Barbie that can listen to your kids. The  Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/26/hackers-can-hijack-wifi hello-barbie-to-spy-on-your-children.  The two articles above give a real-life example of one of the disadvantages of using IoT  technology: unrestricted privacy. Privacy is a huge concern among people, as we value our  credentials and cannot tolerate them being compromised by the hands of cybercriminals.  The two articles describe the problem in more detail by the example of the Wi-Fi- enabled  Hello Barbie Doll that easily carried the audio recordings of children to third-party entities  such as Toy Talk.   These articles will again be used to support the claim that IoT devices are not fully secure  against security and privacy breaches.  9  Disadvantages of Internet of Things: A Literature Review   The Internet of Things enables our everyday appliances to adapt to our daily routines and  thus it automates our daily activities. However, it still has some disadvantages that IoT users fail  to consider. As discussed earlier, the Internet of Things raises two significant problems; it does  not protect our privacy and it becomes dysfunctional when there is variation among its many  distinct software and hardware components.   Privacy and Compatibility Issues   Privacy   Privacy of our data is one of the two things that IoT devices do not promise. This paper  gathers information from two Guardian articles written by journalist Samuel Gibbs, and each  article reports an incident in which an IoT device had been either hacked remotely or proven to  be hackable. Gibbs’s first article was published in July 2015. It recited the story of WIRED  News reporter Andy Greenberg’s frightening experience with the Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep as it was  being remotely maneuvered by a group of two security researchers Charlie Miller and Chris  Valasek. The researchers carried out this hack on their car, particularly with Greenberg in it,  because they wanted to spread awareness to drivers that automatic vehicles are not completely  safe through a trusted news channel like WIRED News. By July 16, Fiat Chrysler released a  security update for its Uconnect internet-enabled software system, which had previously been  used as an unshielded window into the Jeep’s controls. According to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  (FCA), Jeep owners could manually install the update into their car by visiting their  manufacturer onsite.   Matt Jakubowski, in Gibbs’s second article, argues that the Wi-Fi-enabled Hello Barbie  Doll could be considered a hackable device in a similar fashion, except that its users-youth-are  10  not pitted directly against danger. The Barbie Doll forwarded its conversations with children to  ToyTalk and ToyTalk followed suit to its partners. ToyTalk did this in order to improve the  doll’s speech recognition capability. However, Jakubowski’s counterargument is that the users  of the doll were likely to endanger themselves and their internet connected devices if a  cybercriminal grasped their conversions with the doll. Gibbs’s article does not clarify whether  ToyTalk made any attempts to revoke its policies in order to protect its user’s privacy.  Malfunctions in IoT   In a newsletter written by (Banafa, 2017) on behalf of the Institute of Electrical and  Electronics Engineers (IEEE), technical writer Ahmed Banafa presents several flaws in the  architecture of most IoT technologies that impede its performance in industrial settings. As  (Banafa, 2017) argues, compatibility issues occur due to a lack of standardization in an IoT’s  wireless protocols, cloud infrastructure, and firmware in order to establish connectivity within its  network.   Additional Disadvantages of IoT   Besides the numerous benefits of IoT, (Balaji et al., 2019) highlights a number of other  issues -along with lack of security and compatibility-that are found in IoT technology. As one  example, the article states that IoT devices drain out colossal amounts of energy and resources,  as shown by one its cited sources. According to (Alaa et al., 2017), “various factors cause   problems in energy consumption in smart home systems, including systematic misuse of  services, inefficient maintenance, lack of or ineffective security systems, and mismanagement of  applications, which is linked to the requirements set by users.” Some of this energy consumption  11  in smart homes is caused by electrical fires that burn out some IoT devices in the event of a  power load or short circuit (Alaa et al., 2017).   (Balaji et al., 2019) also infers that the degree to which IoT has introduced automation in  menial jobs can in turn lay off many workers. Their journal review, however, does not provide  any footnotes to back this claim. In fact, a separate study that sought to answer whether  automation has affected employment in the South African apparel industry concluded that it has  not, since South Africa’s apparel industry has not fully accepted the process of automating  sewing. The researchers who conducted this study gathered their data from the responses of 26  stakeholders of the industry and analyzed their data using qualitative techniques, whose results  were then fed into an application called NVivo in order to establish conclusions of this study (Parschau & Hauge, 2020).   Conclusion   Even though this paper focused on informing the general public about how vulnerable to  security breaches IoT devices are and how easily IoT devices can stop functioning, there still  some successful applications of IoT in use today.   A portion of (Balaji et al., 2019)’s review article, lays out several applications pertaining  to IoT in the present day. These applications are not touched upon in this paper. However, they  are worth mentioning here, because IoT disadvantages do not occur in these applications. For  example, Ozone monitors automatically detect the presence of ozone molecules in the process of  dying meat that is employed in the food industry (Balaji et al., 2019). Moreover, ultraviolet  radiation monitors show the level of UV radiation in different areas of the body and also informs  people of this information, including those who experience higher levels of radiation (Balaji et  12  al., 2019). There are also potential advancements that could be made in smart cities with the use  of IoT technology. As figure 6 of the journal article shows, some of these technological  advancements include walking and crossing paths designated to pedestrians according to their  age and instantaneous flow of traffic, monitors that notify trash pickup spots, and traffic route  monitors to minimize traffic congestion in smart cities.  13  References   Alaa, M., Zaidan, A.

Final_Report,2193,8,"﻿IS350 Red Light Cameras  A city mayor must decide between two choices in order to address the issue of red light running in his or her city. He or she must either authorize installation of red light cameras in the city or pass legislation that shortens the period of time the traffic signal stays yellow.  The moral agent of this situation is the city mayor and also the city’s law enforcement team. The city mayor is a moral agent of this situation because he has to make a decision to resolve the issue of red-light running. The city’s law enforcement is also another moral agent of this situation because it has to actually implement the city mayor’s order.  The integrity of the city’s law enforcement is at stake here because both red light running preventive measures are flawed. For one, red light cameras do not always detect a red light runner, There have been several cases in which it failed to do just that. For example, in Plano, Texas, red light cameras violators used to pay $75 worth of fines from missing the red light and some drivers admitted that the cameras did not always catch violators based on their experience. In one case, police officials issued two red-light tickets to a couple, even though only one individual of the couple had been driving (Hauser). A separate case involved a trailer and a truck driver. The trailer owner was charged with running his trailer past a red light, despite the fact that a truck driver had been driving his trailer at the time of violation.  Shortening yellow timing is also not flawless at preventing red light violations. It reduces the reaction time of drivers. In regards to driving, reaction time is defined as the time it takes for him or her to remove his or her foot from the acceleration pedal to the brake pedal in response to the signal light turning red. More than anything else, lives are at stake here. These are the lives of the drivers and pedestrians who travel with the city. Shortened yellow timing and red light cameras still carry risk of physically hurting drivers and pedestrians. Sortended Yellow timing, for example, can increase rear-end collisions. In extreme cases, a rear-end collision can cause whiplash injuries, which encompass symptoms such as headaches, muscle strain, chronic pain, and bruised muscles.  Red light cameras at intersections can cause more front-into-side collisions between two cars. Even in less fatal collisions, such as front-into-side collisions, adults over the age of 55 and who occupy the backseat of vehicles are still at risk of incurring gruesome injuries. This is because automobile manufacturers have made little modification to the backseats of a car than to the driver and passenger seats. The same applies to women who face an “... elevated risk of head and neck injuries of head and neck injuries…” (Gibson).  The stakeholders are drivers and pedestrians. Either can lose his or her life and might gain a few condolences by a stroke of luck.  A possible course of action is to not install red light cameras at city intersections or shorten yellow timing. As explained earlier, red light cameras can inflict so much harm on pedestrians. They could possibly end their life rather than keep them safe while they are about to cross an intersection. The problem with shortening yellow timing is that it could reduce the driver’s reaction time and thus potentially cause his or her vehicle to collide with a pedestrian or a neighboring vehicle. Besides both of these enforcement measures I would recommend the city mayor to have a law enforcement official present at every intersection in his or her city. This will encourage drivers to be aware of their surroundings more than with red light cameras. In case of an accident, the law enforcement officer could then contact the nearby hospital and get the injured person(s) required medical attention and arrest red light runners on the spot. Another possible course of action is the city mayor to authorize the installation of red light cameras only at city intersections. The tickets issued due to red light violations that are captured by the cameras can increase revenue for the city and allocate funds to be used in the cities welfare programs. A disadvantage of using red light cameras though still remains and it is that it is still neither accurate nor guarantees the safety of pedestrians at city intersections.  A consequence of stationing law enforcement officers at city intersections rather than implementing either of aforementioned safety measures against red light running is that red light violators will at least be easily caught red handed by the police officer on duty. Furthermore, pedestrians who unfortunately encounter a collision with an incoming vehicle will be given medical assistance immediately because the police officers present will be able to call medical practitioners at the instant a tragedy occurs. There are several consequences-good and bad-of using red light cameras. A huge disadvantage of them is that they do not prevent reckless drivers from hurting pedestrians at a red light signal. However, there are more advantages to using red light cameras than shortening yellow timing. One is that the costly tickets that these cameras issue could cause drivers to abandon driving and thus decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Decrease transportation activity has resulted in a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as we saw during the COVID-19 lockdown. During the lockdown, for example, greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 14.7 percent in the U.S. because people stopped taking public transportation (Plumer).  Kantianism 2nd formulation is another ethical theory that would support the use of red-light cameras. It does not outlaw use of inanimate objects if they are used for one’s own benefit. An abridged yellow timing or use of red light cameras will not only benefit the city mayor who is the stakeholder of this scenario but also cautious drivers and pedestrians. Red light cameras catch red light runners and thus prevent tragedies that affect either a pedestrian or a neighboring driver, if a reckless driver fails to stop his or her vehicle on a red signal light. To give an example of such tragedies, Mr. and Mrs. Bhattacharya lost their 7-year-old son Pronoy during a red-light car accident that occurred as the trio was walking along an intersection in Albuquerque (Romero). If yellow timing is shortened, considerate drivers will react to the signal light early and therefore brake their cars on time. In order to save pedestrians, Kantianism 2nd formulation would not forbid the use of the red light cameras or traffic signals with shortened yellow timing.  Act Utilitarianism states that a person’s course of action is morally right if and only if the action produces the greatest good for everyone. Accordingly, the theory would not warrant use of either Red Light Cameras or shortening yellow timing to stop red light violations. Both methods of law enforcement can potentially kill people occupying a four-wheeled vehicle or individuals  crossing an intersection. Therefore both of these methods do more harm than good. Rule Utilitarianism restricts any action that would result in the least amount of good done by enforcing laws on every individual. Society constantly will modify rules to meet everyone’s needs. Here, rule utilitarianism would encourage legal action to be taken against the use of red light cameras or shortening yellow timing, because red light cameras could result in harm done to pedestrians and shortening yellow timing could harm drivers. Lives of both categories of individuals could be lost due to the usage of red light cameras or shortened yellow timing. Social Contract Theory states that everyone in a society must abide by every law. The cameras do not violate the privacy of drivers, because they are enforced in all states either by state law or city ordinance or a combination of both. California’s state law for example permits the use of red-light cameras to catch drivers who drive past a red signal light. Violations must pay a base fee of $100 and an additional $400 per point they are assigned (“Automated enforcement laws”). Thus, state laws and city ordinances serve as contracts which drivers must abide by or face consequences for if they violate any of them.  Virtue theory simply means that if we focus on being good, our actions will reflect our goodwill. Virtue Theory, which approves actions that promote the welfare of others, would not oppose the city mayor’s decision to either shorten yellow timing or installing Red Light Cameras at intersections within his city. Both courses of action would make intersections for pedestrians safer, even though neither would stop collisions from happening. Nevertheless, the city mayor would authorize either shortening yellow timing or installing red light cameras with good intentions in mind, such as making intersections safer to cross by doing so. Therefore, virtue theory would not oppose the city mayor’s action.  Clause 3.1, which states “Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work” in the ACM Code of Ethics would apply to this situation. Clause 3.1 would essentially pardon the city's Police Department for using either red light cameras or shortening yellow timing because these measures are meant to discourage drivers from red light running and save pedestrian lives. The Police Department’s overall intention is promoting public good. Another ACM Code of ethics that could be applied to this situation is code 2.9, which asks IT professionals to “Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.” Red Light Cameras are not secure simply because they cannot be trusted to identify red light runners all the time and such ambiguity that the cameras spread could put lives of pedestrians at risk. Lastly ACM code of ethics 1.4 would be applicable here too. It states that computing professionals should be fair and take steps to not discriminate. Red Light Cameras also do not discriminate between drivers who are readying themselves to make a turn on a red signal and those who rush past the signal. It has issued tickets to both parties regardless of their circumstances.  Clause 1.02 is a Software Engineering Code of Ethics that would be applicable to this situation. In summary, it asks software engineers to equally favor the interests of their employers, clients, and users, given that their interests promote public good. The city mayor faces a dilemma in the first place because he or she needs to make a decision that would decide the fate of the people living in the city. The city mayor does not want the city’s pedestrians or drivers to lose their lives on the road due to reckless driving. As I discussed earlier, red light running could harm as many as 800 pedestrians. Therefore, the city mayor wants to take measures that would prevent deaths of the people living in the city due to red light running particularly. In other words his interests reflect public good. Clause 1.03 would also be applicable in this case because it says that software engineers should only approve software that “meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish privacy or harm the environment.” Red light cameras cannot accurately detect violators hundred percent of the time. Drivers who are preparing to turn on a red signal may cross an intersection unknowingly, but still be charged for committing a violation that they did not intend to do so (Hauser). Lastly, clause 2.03, which states that IT professionals should “use the property of a client or employer only in ways properly authorized, and with the client’s or employer’s knowledge and consent” applies to this case as well. According to the IIHS, license seekers have to acknowledge that their vehicle will be monitored by red light cameras in the state that they drive in at the time of receiving their driver’s license. Thus, drivers do give consent to usage of red light cameras upon receiving their license. I would recommend the mayor to install Red Light Cameras at each intersection in his or her city. Red Light Cameras would inflict less painful injuries on the stakeholders of this situation in the short term. In the long term, people would prefer other forms of transportation over cars because they would not want to be responsible for the cost of a red light violation ticket. In addition, red light cameras could discourage the public from driving on the roads. Thus greenhouse gas emission would significantly decrease in the long term of humanity’s existence.

Lab_212,609,4,"﻿Physics Laboratory Report  Title   Lab number and Title: Lab 212:   Measurement of e/m for an Electron  Name: Rahul Shah Group ID: Cohort Y  Date of Experiment: 4/1/2021 Date of Report Submission: 4/11/2021 Course & Section Number: PHYS121A030 Instructor’s Name: Yanxing Yang   Partners’ Names: Esteban Martinez   Mesa  1. INTRODUCTION   1.1 OBJECTIVES  In this lab, we measure the charge to mass ratio e/m for an electron.  1.2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND  An electron moving in a region where both electric and magnetic fields  are present, experiences two forces: electrostatic Fe and magnetic FB. If  these two forces are of equal magnitude and opposite in direction the  electron will continue on its path, undeflected. This is depicted by figure  1 of the lab manual.   In a case where only a uniform magnetic field is present, the electron  does deflect and steer away from its line of motion. The force FB is always  perpendicular to the velocity and B-field vectors and thus the electron  moves in a circular orbit and experiences a centripetal force whose  magnitude is equal to the product of evB. The centripetal force is  perpendicular to the velocity of the electron and therefore, evBsin(90) is  simply evB.  2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE   Step I. E and B Both On:  Students will set the potential between the plates to about 3000 V and set  the Helmholtz current to a value such that it results in zero deflection of the  electron. In our experiment, we set the current to 0.380 A and observed the  electron move in a straight line on the x-axis of the coordinate paper. Step II. E Off and B On:  In a pair of students, one student will connect the bottom black cable to  the top red cable on the panel of the Power Supply 813 and then move the black  cable from (-) to (+). After that the other student will turn the power supply  on and set potential to 3000 V and keep the current same as in Step I.

Using the  MATLAB code provided by our instructor, we did not have to “guess” the value of  the radius. The code calculated the radius of the arc, velocity of the electron,  and the theoretical and experimental ratio of an electron as well as the percent  error between those two ratios. The percent error between both ratios was  significantly high, as seen in the command window of MATLAB.  The reason why the experimental charge to ratio is different from the  theoretical charge to mass ratio of an electron is because we do not know the  exact radius of the electron’s circular orbit. Only a portion-an arc-of the  electron’s path could be seen on the coordinate plane in the presence of the  magnetic field.   Attachment of Raw Data (see next page)"

INTRODUCTION   1.1 OBJECTIVES  In this lab, we looked at the voltage across a capacitor V as a  function of time t in an RC circuit.   1.2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND   An RC circuit is a circuit that is equipped with both a resistor (R) and a  capacitor (C). Before charging a capacitor, the capacitor has 0C of charge and  voltage across both the resistor and capacitor in the circuit is 0V. When  charging takes place, charge builds up on the capacitor until the voltage of the  capacitor equals that provided by the battery in the circuit. Then current stops  flowing into the capacitor. When discharging of capacitor occurs, current starts flowing again from the charge stored in the capacitor and Q in the capacitor and  V in the resistor become 0.  2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE   Part A  I In this part of the lab, students will find two time constants- one for  discharging the capacitor and one from charging it. First, they should set up the  circuit as seen in Figure 5 of the lab manual. Then, students should make sure  that the switch is in position A and charge the capacitor fully to the 5V  reading. After that, students bring the switch to position B and start  discharging the capacitor. They should keep track of the voltage change through  the capacitor during this process. Finally, students will compare the value of  the time constant calculated by MATLAB, to the expected value of the time  constant.  Under steps 5 – 9, in “Charging capacitor”, students must fully discharge  the capacitor first then, bring the switch back to position A and restart the  stopwatch at the same time. Finally, they must find the time constant calculated  by MATLAB and compare it to the expected value of the time constant. They repeat  steps 1 – 7 in the first paragraph for varying capacitors.  3 RESULTS   3.1 EXPERIMENTAL DATA   Actual R: 34.87 * 10^3 Ohms  Actual C: 1238 * 10^-6 Farads   Discharging: V when switch is  flipped at t=0 	Vfinal (Vo/e)  	Experimental Time  constant (RC)as  shown in video 	MATLAB Time   constant (RC) 	4.986 V  	1.834 V  	48.19s  	33.7560s 	           Charging: V when switch is  flipped at t=0 	Vfinal Vo(1-1/e)  	Experimental Time  constant (RC) as  shown in video 	MATLAB Time   constant (RC) 	0.006 V  	3.152 V  	47.28s  	33.0548s 	           4 ANALYSIS and DISCUSSION   Part A  Discharging Capacitor   It takes time T=RC to lower Vo down to Vo/e. The voltage on the capacitor at  which the switch is flipped to position B and the capacitor starts to discharge  in the video is 4.986 V. The voltage lowers down to 1.834V (Vo/e) at t = 48.19s,  so 48.19s is the time constant for discharging the capacitor. MATLAB calculated  a time constant of 33.7560s and the percent error between these two time values  was 21.8052 percent.   Charging Capacitor  It takes time T=RC to bring Vo up to Vo(1-1 /e). The voltage on the capacitor  at which the switch is flipped to position A and the capacitor starts to charge  in the video is 0.006 V. The voltage escalates to 3.152V (Vo(1-1/e)) at t =  47.28s, as shown in the video. Therefore, 47.28s is the time constant for  charging the capacitor. As shown under “Charging” in Results, MATLAB calculated  a time constant of 33.0548s and a percent error of 23.4293 percent between these  two time values. 5 CONCLUSIONS   Voltage across a capacitor will give an accurate measure of the time  constant of an RC-circuit. In discharging the capacitor, the voltage  decreases as charge on the capacitor decreases. On the other hand, voltage  will increase when a capacitor charges up, until the voltage becomes that  shown on the battery in the circuit. To test this out, we measured the time  it took for the voltage to increase and decrease to a known value in both  cases. We also made use of MATLAB to see whether the time constants  calculated by MATLAB for each case match to the expected time constants.  They do differ significantly, as indicated by the percent errors. In  addition, MATLAB plotted the graphs of V(t) vs. t for each case, along with  a graph of ln(V(t)/Vo) vs. t in discharging the 33kOhms capacitor and a  graph of ln(1-(V(t)/Vo) vs. t in charging the same capacitor."

INTRODUCTION  1.1 OBJECTIVES  In this lab, students will construct and analyze the current in an RL  circuit.   1.2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND  An RL or a resistor-inductor circuit looks very similar to an RC  circuit, but instead of having a resistor and a capacitor, an RL circuit  includes both a resistor and an inductor, and possibly a source of emf. It  also has a switch that connects from positions A to B. When switch flips to  position A, current starts flowing at t = 0 and there is no current when the  switch moves to position to B.   2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE   Students will first create the setup as shown in figure 2 of the lab manual. Then they will fill out all the parameters asked for in table give under step  number 2 under lab procedures. Students will then open up the capstone file that  is given in step 8 of Procedure under lab 218. Students will set the frequency  to 50Hz under 850 Output 1, and make sure all values are set as told in step 8. Next students will click the RECORD button and graph Voltage (V)  vs. time and find the maximum mean voltage value in the graph. Using the  capstone software, students will obtain two different slope values-one in the  ln(i(t)/i0) vs. t plot and one in the ln(1- i(t)/i0) vs. t plot and use each  value to calculate the time constant for the inductors used in this experiment.  3 RESULTS  3.1 EXPERIMENTAL DATA   4  Inductor  	Inductance (mHenries)  	Resistance (ohms) 	Current loop  	22.7  	6.8 	Solenoid  	7.70  	1.7 	    Resistance in resistor: 10.2 ohms  Solenoid:        Current loop:         5 ANALYSIS and DISCUSSION  1. The time constant is L/R. Both ln(i(t)/i0) vs. t plot and one in the ln(1- i(t)/i0) vs. t plot have a slope of magnitude R/L. Therefore, the time  constant is the reciprocal of R/L.  In the solenoid case and ln(i(t)/i0) vs. t plot, the slope of the plot is - 1660, so the time constant for it is 1/1660 = 6.02*10^-4 seconds. In the ln(1- i(t)/i0) vs. t plot, the slope is -1600, so the time constant for it is 1/1600 =  6.25*10^-4 seconds.   In the circuit loop case and ln(i(t)/i0) vs. t plot, the slope of the plot  is -2070, so the time constant for it is 1/2070 = 4.83*10^-4 seconds. In the  ln(1- i(t)/i0) vs. t plot, the slope is -9410, so the time constant for it is  1/9410 = 1.06*10^-4 seconds.   2. As for the theoretical values of the time constant, it is important to note  that the inductors do not have negligible resistance. In the case of a  solenoid RL circuit the theoretical time constant is (7.7*10^-3)/(10.2 + 1.7)  or 6.47*10^-4 seconds. In the case of an induced circuit loop RL circuit the  theoretical time constant is (22.7*10^-3)/(10.2 + 6.8) or 1.34*10^-3 seconds.  As you can see, the theoretical values different a lot from the experimental  ones.  6 CONCLUSIONS   The current i cannot change abruptly in a circuit that contains an inductor,  so i must be a continuous function of time t. However, the rate of change of the  current di/dt can change abruptly. The instantaneous current i first rises  rapidly, as it did in this lab when the switch flipped to position A at t = 0.  Then it increases more slowly and approaches the final value I=ϵ/RI=ϵ/R  asymptotically. At a time, equal to L/R, the current has risen to (1−1/e), or  about 63%, of its final value. The quantity L/R is therefore a measure of how  quickly the current builds toward its final value; this quantity is called the  time constant for the circuit."

INTRODUCTION  1.1 OBJECTIVES  Students will demonstrate Faraday’s law and become more familiar with  concepts of changing magnetic flux and induced current associated with  Faraday’s law.   1.2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND   Changing the magnetic flux through a coil generates or induces an emf  (electromotive force) in the wire. This is perfectly demonstrated by moving a  bar magnet with North and South poles through a loop of wire.  In this lab students will make use of Helmholtz coils, instead of bar  magnets to fluctuate the magnetic flux through the induced coil. The magnetic  field between the coils linearly increase or decrease over time, which causes a  constant change in magnetic flux through the small now-induced coil. The small  coil resists the changes in flux by inducing an emf. The sign of induced emf is  opposite to that of the change in current. The magnetic flux density B through a  coil is directly proportional to current. When the current increases the magnetic  flux density will increase.  2 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE    Students will first create the setup as shown in figure 4 of the lab manual.  Then they will fill out all the parameters asked for in table 1. Students will  then open up the capstone file that is given in step 6 of Procedure under lab  223. After clicking the “tare” button on the magnetic field senso, students will  set the frequency to 2Hz under 850 Output 1, and make sure all values are set as  told in step 8. Next students will click the RECORD button and graph three  graphs within 2 secs: I vs. t, T vs. t, and V vs/ t. V is the induced emf in the  small coil. Finally steps 10 through 16 describe the steps needed to perform  data analysis on the graphs and obtain values asked for in table 2 for  frequencies of 2Hz parallel and 4Hz parallel.   3 RESULTS   3.1 EXPERIMENTAL DATA   4Hz parallel data analysis:              2Hz parallel data analysis:                 3.2 CALCULATION      0.10715 500 0.00064 2000    4 ANALYSIS and DISCUSSION   1.10  -0.0059 0.00475  -0.00608 -0.007  2.14  -0.0115 0.00956  -0.0122 -0.014  -1.09  0.00585 -0.00484  0.00620 0.007 -2.17  0.0117  -0.00968  0.0124  0.014  1. Percent difference between the emf, calculated using dB(t)/dt and the  experimental emf, when frequency is 4Hz parallel is about 12.15%.  Percent difference between the emf, calculated using dI(t)/dt and the  experimental emf, when frequency is 4Hz parallel is about 17.14%. Percent difference between the emf, calculated using dB(t)/dt and the  experimental emf, when frequency is 2Hz parallel is about 12.29%.  Percent difference between the emf, calculated using dI(t)/dt and the  experimental emf, when frequency is 2Hz parallel is about 16.07%.   2. When, small coil is positioned in 45 degree to Helmholtz coils, the  magnitude of induced emf is actually 0.005V which is less than 0.007V, so  it decreases.  3. Using the right hand, we determine the direction of the induced emf or  current. Curl the fingers of the right hand around the area vector of the  small coil, with right thumb in the direction of the vector. If the  induced emf or current in the circuit is positive, it is in the same  direction as curled fingers; if the induced emf or current is negative,  it is in the opposite direction.  5 CONCLUSIONS   Induced emfs are caused by changes in flux. It can be tempting to think  that flux is the cause of induced emf and that an induced emf will appear in a  circuit whenever there is a magnetic field in the region bordered by the  circuit. However, only a change in flux through a circuit, not flux itself,  can induce an emf in a circuit, as in the small coil used in this experiment.  If the flux through a circuit has a constant value, whether positive,  negative, or zero, there is no induced emf. We also learned that an induced  emf will appear in a circuit if the flux is changed for any reason, including  rotating the circuit relative to the magnetic field or changing the circuit’s  shape."
Microencon_Globalization_Internation _Trade_Essay,1945,6,"﻿Rahul Shah  Billy Bataille  ECON265-454  03/27/2022  An Economic Analysis of the Ukraine-Russia War  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began near the end of February 2022. Hundreds of civilians have died in the war and a recent attack on Mariupol hospital injured even more mothers, brothers, sisters, fathers, and children. Individuals in Germany and elsewhere showed their outrage of the invasion by participating in large protests. Some U.S. war veterans, such as Hector, a former Marine, volunteered to fight in combat against the Russian military in Ukraine (Philipps). Since February 2022, many countries in the EU and around the globe have also been collectively denouncing Mr. Putin’s attempt to take Ukraine by imposing economic sanctions on Russia. Sanctions are penalties that one country imposes on another country to compel it to stop acting aggressively or forbid it from defying international law. A country often places sanctions on another country to avoid having to wage wars against it. Several countries retaliated by placing economic sanctions such as embargos on Russia imports, travel bans, and some unfavorable financial measures that hurt Russian and American individuals.  An embargo is a law that prohibits trade with another country. The UK and member nations of the European Union (EU) have decided to cease exporting luxury goods such as vehicles and high-end fashion products to Russia. Besides placing an embargo on some Russian goods, the UK has also decided to place a 35 % tax in the form of tariffs on some Russian imports such as vodka (“What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?”). Tariffs increase the prices of foreign goods and often encourage consumers to buy products sold domestically. The UK, US, EU, together with some small countries have also banned dual-use items from Russia. These are chemicals and lasers. In addition to luxury goods, the U.S, EU, and UK in alliance with Canada have stopped receiving all Russian flights at their airports.  Russian citizens, especially billionaires suffered grave losses by the Ukraine-Russia War. Commonly known as oligarchs, these individuals have demonstrated close ties to the Kremlin. To name a few, owner of the Chelsea football club Roman Abramovich was deprived of all rights to the team by the UK government. The UK government recently canceled sale of all the club match tickets, Chelsea FC merchandise, and did not leave an option for the football club to buy or sell its players to other leagues. Moreover, the UK government froze Mr. Abramovich’s other assets, and his football club is one of them. This means that Mr. Abramovich can no longer even sell his team, as he planned to do earlier. However, current ticket-holders will be allowed to attend scheduled games (“What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?”). Freezing assets is analogous to a bank freezing one of its user’s accounts. When a bank freezes the checking account or saving account of an individual, he or she cannot make any transactions from that account. People can still deposit money to their frozen accounts but cannot withdraw money from it (Hayes). Similarly, individuals whose assets are frozen by a lawful authority cannot sell or profit from their assets. Another Russian oligarch who currently is at the brink of losing his assets due to resistance against the war is a former professional fencer and present-day businessperson of the name Alisher Usmanov. He owns 50 percent of shares of a company called USM Holdings. As of February 28, 2022, the UK seized his house property in London and a Tudor Mansion outside of London (Sandford). Russia has been the main supplier of oil and gas for the U.S. and EU countries. President Biden took another attempt at weakening Russia’s economy by banning imports of Russian oil at the beginning of March. In his early morning White House briefing, he warned gasoline prices will rise across all states. Indeed, his prediction came true. Gasoline prices shot through the roof in California, for example. During the first week of March, prices of a select group of gasses stayed around $6, but the state average price of gas reached above $5 the following week (Solis). As the AAA reported on March 8th, “The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline reached $4.173” (Solis), which is approximately 1.43 percent more than the previous national average of $4.114, excluding effects of inflation. Consequently, commuting to work became a challenge for many Americans. For example, Destiny Harrell commuted regularly to her job at a public library in Santa Barbara. However, she told Times that she will not be able to afford a 15-minute drive from her home to the workplace now and will consider working remotely (Corkery et al.). Many Americans have blamed the Biden administration for the rise in prices, while some believe that the embargo of Russian oil is a necessary measure to stop Mr. Putin’s aides from further invading Ukraine. The EU whose Russian oil imports account for 40 percent of the pie, also followed suit. It aims to make all European countries independent of Russian energy by 2030 (“What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?”).  Just as Americans are not benefitting from US sanctions imposed on Russia, so are Russians themselves. The value of the ruble has drastically depreciated relative to the dollar since the war commenced. As shown in the line graph below, the last reported value of the ruble was 112.03 rubles per US Dollar on March 4, 2022. Stated differently, one ruble cost around 0.0089 or 89-ten-thousandths of a U.S. dollar. The line graph above also shows that on Feb 25th, 2022, the exchange rate for rubles to dollars was 83.86 ruble per US Dollar or 0.0119 dollars per ruble. The fall in the U.S. dollar–ruble exchange rate implies that the U.S. dollar increased in value, or appreciated between February 25th and March 4th, relative to the ruble. Conversely, the ruble has lost value, or depreciated in the same period because ruble holders must have had to spend 28.17 rubles more to obtain $1.00. In the study of economics, a “strong” dollar raises the cost of U.S. goods and services so foreign consumers buy fewer U.S. exports. On the other hand, a “strong” dollar means foreign goods and services cost U.S. consumers less than domestic goods so the U.S. buys more foreign imports. When the U.S. stopped importing Russian oil, however, U.S. consumers were left with other choice than to buy gasoline domestically.     Western goods and services became scarce after the war. Almost all Western commercial brands stopped operating in Russia to show disapproval of Mr. Putin’s efforts to take over Ukraine. Unilever, for example, restrained from allowing imports and exports of products made by its children companies like Dove and Sunsilk (""Companies That Have Pledged to Stop Business in Russia""). Huge retailers such as Ikea, closed most of its shops in Russia except its shopping Mega, which has served to provide Russian customers with some essentials (""Companies That Have Pledged to Stop Business in Russia""). Clothing retailers such as Nike closed 116 of its stores in Russia (""Companies That Have Pledged to Stop Business in Russia""). Food franchises in Russia also stopped conducting business on the streets of Russia. Mars, which is a major supplier of M&M and the Snickers candy bars, recently halted new investments(""Companies That Have Pledged to Stop Business in Russia""). McDonald’s temporarily closed 850 of its franchise restaurants across Russia. Starbucks, a well-known coffee brand in the United States, also suspended all its operations in Russia(""Companies That Have Pledged to Stop Business in Russia""). The tech industry has also played a part in the decline of commercial activity in Russia. Google stopped displaying advertisements on its search engine and YouTube (Satariano and Frenkel). Amazon’s cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services stopped offering its cloud solution to new customers based in Russia or Belarus (""Companies That Have Pledged to Stop Business in Russia""). Apple joined along with a horde of other tech giants. It removed Apple Pay in some places of Russia, suspended “two Russian state-run media platforms, Russia Today and Sputnik, from the Apple App Store outside Russia” (Kellen), and stopped accounting for all exports into its Russian sales at the beginning of March 2022.  Mr. Putin did not take the sanctions well. In response to the sanctions, he banned imports of goods such as “…telecoms, medical, vehicle, agricultural, electrical equipment, and timber” (“What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?”). In addition, he said in a statement to the press that he will only accept rubles from nations who severed trading relations with Russia. He intends to do this to raise the value of the ruble. Mr. Putin also authorized cessation of interest payments to foreign investors who own government bonds and prohibited Russian firms to pay their shareholders overseas (“What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?”). According to the theory of relative interest rates in economics, foreign investors buy an increased amount of bonds and other interest-bearing securities issued by a country’s government or private borrowers real interest rates in that country rise. In Russia, this would have increased the demand for rubles and caused the ruble to appreciate before the invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, Russia froze the assets of foreign investors thereby preventing them from selling their expensive stocks and bonds (“What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion?”).  In conclusion, the invasion of Ukraine did not bode well for the future of Russia’s economy. The value of the Russian ruble depreciated significantly in the months following the war. Countries that have pledged to not support Russia targeted Russian oligarchs by freezing their assets. Americans saw a spike in the price of regular gasoline in every state. Lastly, commercial activity decreased in Russia as well when Western brands closed their shopping centers and restaurants in Russia. In order to mitigate the adverse effects of this war on Amercians, I would recommend the Biden administration and other countries to not ban Russian oil. At the current exchange rate of 102 rubles per dollar, lifting the ban would shift the supply curve for dollars rightward and make regular gasoline in America affordable. If the ban is lifted, the equilibrium exchange rate will also decrease, meaning Russian individuals will be able to afford basic necessities to live.

My_Personal_Narrative,926,1,"﻿Rahul N Shah David Tress HUM101-101 9/22/2020 My Story           “Alright, that’s our discussion for today, flip to the next page, where you’ll find your,-”  I dreaded to think of those words that I had heard in my 10th grade English class, because they sent chills up my body, heralding another “Writing Assignment”.   I first encountered this fear in 4th grade of my elementary school.  I sat blankly staring at the chalkboard of my classroom while Mrs. Georgewich had left my class for a short writing assignment on some eccentric philosophical thought that had dawned on her from an episode of The Magical School Bus.  Since I was not a native English speaker, I had struggled to lift my pencil, but Mrs. Georgewich was an avid observer.  She knew I had learned English enough to write a sentence or two, but I still balked at the lined white paper, unable to shake myself out of its nothingness.  I heard giggles in the back of the classroom so I swung my eyes left and right and saw my classmates diminish the granite of their pencil into their paper and some were even happily watching at another rerun of the Magical School Bus while munching on animal graham crackers that Mrs. Georgewich had brought for us.  Not for me though.  Not until Mrs. Georgewich was satisfied with how much I had written.  She would pounce on them whenever I reached for a treat-that to my surprise, was intricately carved into a Giraffe or an Elephant.  I sought inspiration in them instead to erode the shackles that kept me from getting down anything on my paper.  They did not vanish at that point and bound me to this dilemma of not knowing what to do with my pencil in hand.  After it seemed that I had given up on my writing assignment, Mrs. Georgewich scribbled an uncut “F” on my paper.  It was exactly 12:00 pm when the sound of the bell over my 10th grade English classroom’s microphone pierced my ears.  I was sitting in that same dark oak wooden desk situated before a wall on which hung the colorful posters.  They said, “Tips to Improve your writing” and ‘Bad Grammar to Watch Out For!”, as if meant for a 5-year old toddler learning his first words.  I was not a toddler anymore.  I was instead a full-time high school freshman, sitting in front of a page of my textbook and among peers who I knew had coerced themselves with years of practice into building a knack for reading and writing.   Our assignment was simple: write a 5-paragraph essay, describing Holden Caufield’s character.  It was by far, my most abhorred book. I walked home that day with a bewildered look on my face, not knowing where to start on paper on Holden’s personality.  He was after all, ambiguous in his interactions in his own bleak world, of which he had no control over.  I spent hours seeing the cursor on my computer screen blink in and out.  Perhaps, I knew what I wanted to type but was too hesitant to type it because it was not above Shakespearean standards.  After some more hours of reading articles that I found on the web and sentences that I could paraphrase in my own words, I finished a good page.  When I pulled my cursor down to the bottom of my computer screen, my confidence shattered into pieces.  It was not that I closed my word document before clicking ‘Save’, but that I sat late into midnight.  My paper was due the next day so I scurried back to my kitchen for a quick drink of water so I would not start screaming at my siblings, who were readying their bed.  My parents were not happy with me sitting any later that 12 into the night and still being clueless about my essay for English.  Alas, I had to skip school for the next day.  It was one my stupidest attempts on completing a paper that merely received an “unsatisfactory” check.  I learned my lesson but did not do anything to improve my writing than ask my friends to help me.   One year later, I took my first SAT.  I scored in the top 900s which was exceptionally worse than I had expected.   I scrolled down helplessly on my report, anticipating some miscalculation or error that may prove my merit.  There was again none but there was a reminder of how poorly I had done with the Reading and Writing section of my exam.  Thus, I decided that reading more and more books was the only way out of this misery.    In the summer of 2018, I got my hands on the Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Volume 1, then The Red Fern.  After I read them, I spent countless hours in the Belleville Public Library perusing a page of research-oriented, nonfiction, and fiction books, before I sat down to take a practice exam.  The more I read them, the more I absorbed words wrung into sentences like plants absorb water.  That summer, I aced my exam, and scored well on my optional essay section of the exam.  I figured there was no way to writing than first putting myself in a writer’s shoes and reading a piece of their work and understanding their purpose, before I get down to writing my own ideas on to a paper.  I continue to do this to this day, and it has evolved me into not only an English speaker but also an English narrator."
Newspaper_Article_Essay_#_1,1676,5,"﻿1  Rahul Shah  HIST213  Haitians that arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in the past two weeks faced a similar dilemma that Armenians did a century ago. Unexpectedly, they were deported to Haiti which has literally nothing for Haitian migrants to sustain themselves. On the other hand, Armenians were deported from their country of residence, which had been the Ottoman Empire since the First Balkan War. While the deportation of Armenians and Haitian migrants arose from different causes, both groups of people suffered from excessive violence and their conflict even divided people in the United States.  One main difference between the Armenian Genocide and recent Haitian deportations is that each arose from a different cause. The genocide occurred to Christian Armenians who had been living in the Ottoman Empire for several years. They mostly occupied Eastern Anatolia at first, along with a large population of Kurdish wayfarers. Armenians often advocated for  autonomy and equality in their provinces, but local courts did not favor them. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, the Ottoman Empire lost nearly all of its territories. Losing its territories to European countries infuriated the Young Turkish government of the Ottoman Empire so much that it accused the Armenians of having collaborated with foreign powers like Russia to defeat the Ottoman Empire.1 Following the Battle of Sarıkamıs, the government disarmed Armenian soldiers and then murdered them. In addition to carrying out this violent campaign against Armenian soldiers, the Young Turkish government forced millions of Armenian civilians living in Eastern Anatolia to scorching deserts and concentration camps. In contrast, most of the  1 de Waal, Thomas. “The G-Word: The Armenian Massacre and the Politics of Genocide.” Foreign Affairs, vol. 94, no. 1, Council on Foreign Relations, 2015, pp. 136–48, http://www.jstor.org/stable/24483226. See paragraph 1 under History As A Battleground. 2  Haitians who came to the U.S-Mexico had not been living in the United States. Most of them came from South America, while others had made their way directly from Haiti, after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake completely destroyed the southern peninsula of Haiti a month earlier. Those coming from South America had left Haiti when it fell apart due to the 2010 earthquake. Most them left to seek employment in places elsewhere than Haiti. Brazil and Chile provided them with a wealth of employment opportunities. For example, Claire Bazile started working as a cleaning lady in Chile’s capital, after she left her family in Haiti. Her job earned her enough money to provide some of it to her mother and siblings in Haiti. When she heard stories of Haitians entering the United States under the Biden administration, she later quit her job to settle in the United States along with other migrants. However, she did not make it past the U.S. Mexico border and was flown back to Haiti.2 Besides employment, there are also other reasons for which many Haitians decided to flee to the United States. During the coronavirus outbreak, Haitian migrants could not easily obtain employment in Brazil. In fact, Brazil’s latest migration status reported that “only a net of about 500 Haitians gained formal jobs in Brazil in the first five months of this year”3, compared to two years before. Some migrants also found it harder to flock to Chile because they were unable to withstand Chile’s immigration policy and border control measures. To make matters worse, Haitians who lived in Chilean citizens often faced discrimination on basis of their dark-colored skin from Chilean citizens.3 Thus, many Haitian migrants from Haiti and South America trudged through the Rio Grande to the United States.  Both ethnic groups experienced hostile treatment in their country as well as their origin of  2 Isaac, Harold, and Catherine Porter. “Haiti Protests Mass U.S. Deportation of Migrants to Country in Crisis.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 19 Sept. 2021, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/world/americas/us-haitian-deportation.html.3 Dobbins, James, et al. “How Hope, Fear and Misinformation Led Thousands of Haitians to the U.S. Border.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 18 Sept. 2021,  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/haitians-border-patrol.html.  3  residence. For 20th century Armenians, the Ottoman Empire was both. Armenians made up a considerable population of the Ottoman Empire. In its last days, the Ottoman Empire killed more than a million Armenians in what came to be known as Armenian Genocide between 1915 and 1916 because it accused them of colluding with Russia, which had been its enemy during World War I. Under Mehmed Talat Pasha’s leadership, the Turkish government deported a staggering million Armenians to nearby deserts of Syria. Turkish security forces and Kurdish criminals killed Armenian men, whereas women and children fell subject to harsh punishment on death marches across the Mesopotamian desert. They were also not given food or water on these marches. U.S. ambassador Henry Morgenthau observed “...attempts to uproot peaceful Armenian populations…. [were].... accompanied by frequent instances of rape, pillage, and murder.”1In Aleppo, U.S. consul Jesse Jackson saw piles of 200 to 300 Armenian corpses littered across the burial grounds in a town adjacent to Maskanah, which is in modern-day Syria. All in all, the Armenian death toll amounted to around one million at the end of World War I and only one-tenth of Armenians remained in the Ottoman Empire.1In the same manner as the Armenians, Haitian migrants were met with brutality by border agents as they made their way to the U.S.-Mexico border. Videos of border agents gathered by journalists Eileen Sullivan and Zolan Kanno-Youngs showed them flinging their reins into the air and waving them at the migrants to prevent migrants from crossing the U.S-Mexico towards the United States. The agents also occasionally screamed vulgar language at the migrants when they tried to neglect their orders. Although the article does not report of any injuries that migrants took, it informs us that the Department of Homeland Security decided to access the border agents’ actions. Back in Haiti, Haitian civilians lived among gang violence, which was directed by the country’s own leaders. Gangs conducted kidnappings and lootings in local areas of Haiti, making them 4  inhabitable for Haitian civilians.4  Lastly, both of these events gained immense popularity in the United States. Despite hearing accounts of many Americans who had witnessed the extermination of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, Turkey’s ambassadors have since denied killing any grandparents of the descendants at the General Assembly and has also advised the U.S. to avoid calling the 1916 massacre a “genocide”. In his 2010 presidential campaign speech, for example, President Obama went only as far as mentioning Meds Yeghern or “Great Catastrophe” to his Armenian voters. He did not want to explicitly acknowledge the event as a “genocide”, because it would have broken diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey. Although President Obama’s speech disappointed many of his Armenian American voters, some Armenian Americans previously achieved reforms that brought awareness to the genocide. Until the 1970s, American Armenians only remembered their genocide at Sunday dinners or at religious gatherings. However, an Armenian American businessman named Stephen Mugar broke his silence and deftly convinced the House to name April 24th of 1975 as the as the ""National Day of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man”. The Senate then spent over the course of two days in 1990 to decide whether or not to change the day to ""Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923”. Many senators did not agree to this, because they did not want Turkey to suspend its essential military bases like the Incirlik Air Base.1In the case of deporting migrants to Haiti, the White House’s own personnel stood divided on this issue. For example, senior envoy Daniel Foote resigned from the Biden administration because he thought sending migrants back to where they had come from would not help them in any way, as living conditions had become unsuitable in  4 Kitroeff, Natalie, and Anatoly Kurmanaev. “How the Assassination of Haiti's President Follows Years of Strife and Gridlock.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 7 July 2021, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/world/americas/haiti-president-assassination.html. 5  Haiti for them.5 Progressives too argued that Mr. Biden should instead uphold his promises of establishing a “humane system”5for migrants by first allowing them into the United States. Unlike Foote, policy advisor Susan E. Rice supported the Biden administration's deportation policy, which was derived from a law called Title 42. Title 42 permitted the United States to deport migrants both this year and during the pandemic. Enacted originally in 1944 as part of the Public Health Service Act, the law authorized federal health officials to prohibit goods and people from entering into the United States during a pandemic. President Trump rejuvenated the law in March 2020 to deter anyone from Mexico or Canada from immigrating to the U.S., with the exception of U.S. citizens, spouses and children of permanent residents, U.S. military personnel and those possessing valid travel documents. In contrast, the Biden administration illegally used it against Haitian migrants and even those who sought asylum, according to several former CDC officials.6  As discussed above, the Armenian Genocide and events leading up to and following Haitian deportations that we saw earlier in September 2021 share similarities and are also different. The Armenian Genocide drew attention of both the American public and Armenian Americans, who have continuously protested against Turkey’s denial of their grandparents’ death in the Ottoman Empire. President Biden’s close advisors and CDC officials also opposed his deportation policy for their aforementioned reasons. People also fell victim violence in both of  5 Jakes, Lara, and Eileen Sullivan. “A Senior U.S. Diplomat to Haiti Resigns, Citing the Biden Administration's 'Inhumane' Deportation Policy.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 23 Sept. 2021, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/23/us/politics/haiti-diplomat-resign-biden.html.6 Bloomberg, Mary Biekert |. “Analysis | Title 42, the Law Removing Haitians from U.S. Border.” The Washington Post, WP Company, 29 Sept. 2021,  https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/title-42-the-law-removing-haitians-from-us-border/20 21/09/24/57971d7e-1d6f-11ec-bea8-308ea134594f_story.html.  6  these events. Apart from similarities, the Armenian Genocide is also different from recent migrant deportations. Turkey’s government killed Armenians because it was outraged at them for supposedly allying with Russia, whereas the United States started deporting Haitian refugees to Haiti, because so many of them arrived to the United States at once this year."
Newspaper_Article_Essay_#_2,1871,7,"﻿Rahul Shah HIST363         The night that unfolded at Astroworld in November 2021 closely resembles the interaction between the U.S government and American soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War. During singer Travis Scott’s performance at Astroworld, a total of eight people died.  By the time Travis heard cries for help from his audience, it had been too late.  Live Nation brought Travis’s concert to halt around 10:10 pm, 30 minutes earlier than it had planned and 40 minutes after law enforcement authorities became aware of it.  A similar situation took place more than 50 years ago, when the United deployed its troops to Vietnam.  The United States initially sent military battalions to Vietnam to “maintain”, but not interfere in the first fight between communist North Vietnam and South Vietnam.  It still lacked any definite objectives, as the war waged on.  The anti-war protests, which followed afterwards and were led by veterans and students at academic institutions depicted the same cries for help from Travis's audience at Astroworld last year.  Taking both of these events into account, we can see that negligence of both Travis and the U.S. government to their chaotic events caused the public to mistrust them.  These two events differ in the amount of excitement that people who found themselves in these times showed to their governing authority and differ in their root causes.    The stakeholders in each historical event introduced above showed strongly different levels of enthusiasm to their governing body.  American men showed almost no enthusiasm as they headed off to Vietnam in helicarriers.  Men ages of 18 and above did everything they could to disqualify themselves in the draft lottery of 1969.  Disabled men were obviously exempted from the war, but healthy men also daringly put their lives at risk in order to not reach the front lines of Vietnam.  In class discussions, we learned for example that some men blasted their toes off of their feet.  Those who were wealthy enough to acquire a doctor’s note, denoting a critical condition of their health, also saved themselves a trip to Vietnam’s tropical and swampy warzone.  An well-known example of someone who was wealthy enough to avoid the military draft is Donald J. Trump7.  He was allegedly diagnosed with bone spurs on his heels, but masked his diagnosis by saying that a high lottery number kept him from going to Vietnam7.  Movies have also accurately depicted public opinion towards the Vietnam War.  In “Across the Universe”, for instance, Max swallows a chunk of cotton into his mouth before meeting a military general, who asks him whether he has any reason to not go to war.  Max courageously tells him a myriad of health conditions in an attempt to save himself, but to the general, Max’s excellent foot posture outweighs any of those.  Thus, he recruits Max anyway[1].  In stark contrast to the dying morale for the Vietnam war that Americans showed in the 1960s, Travis Scott’s Astroworld concert received much more attention.  Scott began his “raging” performance at around 9 pm.  Around 50,000 people had gathered at his two-day Astroworld festival, but the set could have accommodated “over 200,000 people”[2], as Huston fire chief Samuel Pena later confirmed.  Moreover, a short clip taken hours before the show, showed a large crowd rushing in a frenzy past the gates and security personnel guarding Astroworld’s venue.  Some people in the crowd are also seen being engulfed by the surge of concertgoers behind them8. Although Houston officials said that the venue was not overcrowded, they did suspect that some concertgoers may have gained entry without a ticket2.  Besides differences that lie amongst the Vietnam War and Astroworld concert there are also some similarities between the two, such as the fact that moral agents of each situation did not take it seriously until each event led to deaths.    One more similarity that can be drawn between the Astroworld Tragedy and Vietnam War is that the governing body involved in both events tried to downplay gravity of both events until the events literally became too hazardous to be left untouched.  Travis was seen in one captured video exclaiming “I want to see some rages. Who wants to rage?”2 into his mic, while the crowd appeared to be confused and afraid of what was slowly unraveling over the venue.  Travis, as well as some people from the crowd heard several voices of agony among those of excitement.  However, Travis did not apparently comprehend reasons for which some members in his audience were feeling uncomfortable, while watching him perform.  Instead he kept singing. Many moments had passed before Travis became aware that people in his audience were struggling to stand and later he says, “There’s an ambulance in the crowd, whoa, whoa, whoa,”2.  It had been too late to stop a commotion that had spiraled out of his control.   During the 1960s, President Johnson oversaw the conflict in Vietnam.  He believed that continued mobilization of the American army would exhaust the Viet Cong forces and bring an end to the war.  His military strategy backfired in the Tet offensive.  Due to the misreporting of the Tet offensive, the media became even more critical of the Vietnam War and so did the American public who listened to the media[3].  The Tet offensive was a military offensive launched by the North Vietnamese against U.S troops.  It began just as Johnson’s administration had convinced the American public that the Vietnam war was coming to an end and that troops would soon withdraw from Vietnam through his Progress Campaign[4]; on the contrary, he gravely underestimated the North Vietnamese.  A total of nineteen enemy soldiers died along with five Americans who fought to save the American embassy in Saigon3.  Although the American military withstood the Tet offensive and suffered few casualties compared to the North Vietnamese, the Tet offensive delayed their return by a few months4.  In response to the Tet Offensive, media sensationalism contributed significantly to the growing mistrust of Americans for their government.  Many anti-war protests started popping up across the country.  A famously known anti-war protest occurred at Kent State University in 1970.  On the morning of May 4, 1970, more than 3,000 people, including demonstrators, had gathered to defy the National Guard.  They attacked members of the National Guard with rocks.  In order to stop the protesters from advancing Blanket Hill, the National Guard threw tear gas at them and aimed their gunfire towards them.  Four Kent State University students were killed from the gunfire and nine were injured6. The main difference between these two events is that both emerged from different root causes.  America involved itself in the Vietnam war because President Truman feared the domino effect.  The domino effect theory states that if one Asian country falls to communism other countries will follow too.  After the fall of China to the Soviet Union in 1949, U.S. policymakers rushed to draft a foregin policy that would prevent the Soviet Union-previously coined the “U.S.S.R”-from further expansion.  They came up with the NSC-68, which explicitly stated “Any substantial further extension of the area under the control of the Kremlin…would raise the possibility that no coalition adequate to confront the Kremlin with greater strength could be assembled”3.  All other U.S. Presidents after him adapted President Truman's reasoning behind involvement in Vietnam, which prolonged the war even further after the Korean War.  There were also other reasons for which Vietnam all of a sudden became of prime importance to the U.S.  Because Vietnam was surrounded by “strategic waterways''3, provided “access to important raw materials”3 to the U.S,, and sat right next to China’s Southern Border, President Kennedy and then President Johnson did not want Vietnam to be overrun by big communist powers such as China and the Soviet Union.  However, Johnson's administration and other administrations before him since the Korean War failed to contain communist expansion in Asia, particularly, Vietnam.  Consequently, many Americans jumped to the conclusion that either we did not employ strong military tactics against the North Vietnamese or the war simply appeared to be unwinnable, meaning the United States could not have built a nation out of Vietnam regardless of the magnitude of the U.S. military.  Herring argues that the climate and terrain of Vietnam contributed most to the blunders of U.S. troops.  In other words Vietnam was characterized by “hick jungles, foreboding swamps and paddies, rugged mountains, insufferable heat and humidity”3 , so it was no surprise that the U.S. military did not defeat the North Vietnamese, who were not outsiders to Vietnam.  The Astroworld concert, on the other hand, was meant to be another one of Mr. Scott’s fiery, but not deadly performances to which concertgoers often responded by showing their utmost excitement in return.  However, the concert unfortunately took the lives of eight concertgoers.  Previous performances have been haphazardly for concertgoers but not quite deadly for them.  Once, a 15-year-old concertgoers suffered critical injuries due to a stampede at one of Mr. Scott’s concerts[5].  In 2017, Scott was found guilty of provoking his fans into breaking security barriers and paid a fine of $7,465.315.  In 2016, Travis Travis convinced his fans to haul themselves off the balcony of a tall building and then carry him above their arms5.  As evident by these instances, people have aroused in Travis Scott’s performances in such a way that they put their lives at risk at times.  Thus, the Astroworld concert also replicated the same effect on them and resulted in deaths of eight people.    In conclusion, Travis Scott’s 2021 Astroworld concert is similar to what played out in the midst of the Cold War between the U.S. government and its public, including American veterans.  They are also different in that concertgoers at Astroworld enjoyed their time there at first, compared to American troops in Vietnam.  Lastly, both of these events emerged from different motives.  The U.S. invaded Vietnam to protect it from communism.  On the other hand, concertgoers attended Travis Scott’s Astroworld concert simply because they wanted to experience his music, but did not expect it to result in the deaths of eight people.            ________________ [1]  Taymor, Julie, director.

This is a question which many who were present at the 1999 White House gathering did not consider as the world approached the brink of the nineteenth century.  One of the White House guests was writer Elie Wiesel.  In his speech titled The Perils of Indifference,  Wiesel draws on his previous experience as a survivor of the Holocaust along with recollection of other traumatic events such as Kosovo invasion to persuade his audience that inaction in a time of crisis can endanger many lives.  Speaker Elie Wiesel strengthens his argument by appealing to the logical reasoning of his audience, emotions of his audience, and strategically asking them questions that lead them to sympathize with his overall message.           Wiesel alludes to pathos a lot in his speech. Pathos is a literary technique that tugs on the emotions of an audience through a speaker’s use of vivid language, stories, and metaphors.  Wiesel uses strong diction in his storytelling and other areas of his speech to funnel his words to his audience.  In the first paragraph of The Perils of Indifference, he sets the delivery of his argument by presenting a short narrative about the day he was released from Nazi captivity: “Fifty-four years ago to the day, a young Jewish boy from a small town in the Carpathian Mountains woke up not far from Goethe's beloved Weimar, in a place of eternal infamy called Buchenwald. He was finally free, but there was no joy in his heart”(Wiesel, 1) Having said his harrowing tale, Wiesel transports his audience back to Buchenwald, which was one of the largest concentration camps established within Germany in 1937.   The disconnect between the first and second line as well as the situational irony that is apparent into the second line of his short anecdote due to pathos serve to fascinate his audience, so they are tempted at this point to hear Wiesel further explain in his speech why “there was no joy in his heart”(1) after being freed by American soldiers.  Later in his speech, he tells them that he and his acquaintances in the camp believed the “leaders of the free world” (3) were unaware of their miserable treatment in the camps.  When they were freed, they learned that news of the war and the concentration camps around Germany had reached the United States well before it declared war on the Axis Powers.  Thus, Wiesel did not appreciate freedom as it was given to him and so did many other victims, because they ""...felt abandoned, forgotten…” (3).  As the reader can see, strong words and phrases like “abandoned” , “forgotten”, and “no joy in his heart” in Wiesel’s anecdotes signify the inherence of pathos in his speech and allow his audience to better understand his stance on indifference.  Besides anecdotes, Wiesel chooses to express pathos in succinct sentences in his speech.  For example, consider two ways by which Wiesel puts the word ‘indifference’ into perspective for his White House guests.  In paragraph nine of his speech, Wiesel states, “In a way, to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the human being inhuman” (2).  America’s decision to stay out of the European conflict while keeping its trading relations with both Great Britain and Germany transformed Americans as ‘inhuman’ beings in the eyes of the terribly abused prisoners of Auschwitz concentration camp, who Wiesel refers to as ‘Muselmanner[s]’(2)  Because he associates ‘indifference’ to the word ‘inhuman’, which has more negative connotations than the word ‘indifference’, Wiesel’s words speak strongly to his audience rather than him bluntly stating that America should have abandoned neutrality earlier than the Pearl Harbor attacks.  In addition to making Americans seem as ‘inhuman’ people, Wiesel states that “Indifference reduces the Other to an abstraction” (2).  According to Wiesel, everyone is vulnerable to injustice, even those who are closely attached to the entity that is showing no compassion for them.  He explains this by ending his sentence with the word ‘abstraction’, implying that indifference can affect everyone in his audience.  Thus, his perceptions of ‘indifference’ beyond the word’s literal meaning and storytelling portrayed with pathos prompt his audience to comprehend the breadth of content in his speech.  Aside from pathos, Wiesel presents his argument with facts that add credibility to his speech.          Wiesel also alludes to logos to back his argument with facts.  Logos is an important aspect of a speech because it is how a speaker uses logical reasoning to justify his or her argument.  Wiesel refers to numerous historical events that conform to the course of his discussion.  For instance, he reminds his audience of the several times during Holocaust in which the United States-under Roosevelt’s presidency-refused to save Jews from facing oppression.  First, he talks about a ship named St. Louis that sailed from Europe and carried 937 passengers, most of whom were Jewish refugees.  The United States-”...the great country, the greatest democracy, the most generous of all new nations in modern history”(3), - closed its doors to them because they lacked US immigration visas and many Americans feared they would steal their jobs at a time when the country was recovering from the Great Depression.  After turning back, the ship returned to Europe and 254 of its passengers died in the Holocaust.  In addition, Wiesel adds, “It has been suggested, and it was documented, that the Wehrmacht could not have conducted its invasion of France without oil obtained from American sources ""(3).  Here, Wiesel provides truthful evidence in order to prove that the United States stood neutral to the annihilation of millions of Jews while protecting its monetary interests from the war in Europe.  On the other hand, Wiesel digresses in his speech to also note some commendable moments of the nineteenth century.  In the middle of his speech he mentions, “And then, of course, the joint decision of the United States and NATO to intervene in Kosovo and save those victims, those refugees, those who were uprooted by a man, whom I believe that because of his crimes, should be charged with crimes against humanity”(4)   The Kosovo war took place over disagreement between the Albanians and the Serbs, since the Serbs opposed them for land that rightfully belonged to the Albanians.  Unlike with pathos, Wiesel supplements his speech again with factual information to make his argument to his audience.   In the course of his narration, Wiesel asks rhetorical questions that ultimately serve to convince his audience of his message.  Some of these questions provide him a channel to a point that he is making later.  For example, he recounts his escape from Buchenwald with the aid of American soldiers and then poses two questions at the beginning of the second paragraph of his speech: “What will the legacy of this vanishing century be? How will it be remembered in the new millennium?” (1).  Wiesel answers these immediately, saying, “Surely it will be judged, and judged severely, in both moral and metaphysical terms” (1). We can obviously formulate what Wiesel is talking about in his topic sentence; He poses these two questions to his audience because he is trying to shift the focus of their attention from his sorrowful tale of the Holocaust to some significant failures of the nineteenth century--”...two World Wars, countless civil wars,...assassinations (Gandhi, the Kennedys, Martin Luther King, Sadat, Rabin), bloodbaths in Cambodia and Algeria, India and Pakistan, Ireland and Rwanda, Eritrea and Ethiopia, Sarajevo and Kosovo; ...and the tragedy of Hiroshima...Auschwitz and Treblinka”(1)--that happened due to the indifference of many.  Wiesel also asks questions that elicit an emotional reaction from his audience. For example, he asks his audience to consider why President Roosevelt did not allow Jewish civilians to proceed into the United States, even though he knew that they were in desperate need of help.  This approach not only allows Wiesel to justify the hatred for Roosevelt that is rooted in the Jewish history, but also makes his audience reach the same conclusion.  Meanwhile, he mentions the invasion of Kosovo by the United States and NATO as one positive outcome of the nineteenth century, and questions Mr. Clinton along with everyone else what implications can this act of heroism have moving forward: “ Is today's justified intervention in Kosovo, led by you, Mr. President, a lasting warning that never again will the deportation, the terrorization of children and their parents, be allowed anywhere in the world?”(4). Although indirectly, he addresses this question to Mr. Clinton because he is the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. army and has the authority to deploy armed forces in foreign conflicts such as the Kosovo war.  In essence, Wiesel is asking for assurance from the president that the United States on behalf of everyone in the White House that the United States does put its step forth in future international disputes before they turn into wars.          Though as convincing as he may seem, Wiesel is sometimes ambiguous in his words.  Near the end of his statement, Wiesel asks ""What about the children?""(4), reflecting on their unfortunate death in wars that arise from conflicts between adults.  He also notes that children are continuously dying of ""disease, violence, [and], famine""(4), but he does not explicitly refer to any current events that are witness to this claim.  The last historical event of the nineteenth century that he talks about in his speech is the liberation of Albanian refugees and victims in the Kosovo war.  Therefore, the fact that he does not clarify the source of the children’s’ discomfort discredits him as a speaker.           As a final word, Wiesel successfully shapes his speech for his audience.  Throughout The Perils of Indifference, he applies three literary devices-pathos, logos and rhetorical questions-in order to advocate that ignoring one’s misery cannot mitigate it, but it can endanger one’s well-being.

The_One_Child_Policy,1994,1,"﻿Rahul N Shah David Tress                                         HUM101-101 11/23/2020 The One-Child Policy Was the one-child policy beneficial to China’s population?  Statistical evidence regarding the policy’s outcomes would say no.  The policy first came into effect in the 1980s, when China was growing at a population of 978 million.  Nationalist Deng Xiaoping of the People’s Republic of China enacted the policy to curb China’s rapid population growth.  It is said to have prevented 400 million births, but PhD professors Zeng and Hesketh in “The effects of China's universal two-child policy” mentioned critics who argued that it has prevented fewer births than the later-longer-fewer policy that came before it.  The critics also questioned whether the policy was even necessary, since rapid economic development alone had shown to lower the fertility rate in countries like Thailand,” .... where the total fertility rate decreased from 5.6 in 1970, to 2.1 in 1990” (Zeng and Hesketh, 2016, “The one-child policy”, para. 3).  Soon enough, the government modified the terms of policy such that it permitted couples who were either only-children or one of them was the only child to have two children; however, they still required a birth permit issued by the government to have a second child (Zeng and Hesketh, 2016, “The introduction of the universal two-child policy”, para. 1). Despite these exemptions, the one-child policy was disastrous to China’s population because it created a gender imbalance, traumatized women, and thrust irrevocable complications on China’s elderly people. The one-child policy significantly altered the gender ratio in China after its enactment.  Since families in China led their lives by Confucian ideals, they strongly preferred having male children over female children.  Parents believed that males brought agricultural prosperity and can care for their parents in old age.  However, strong devotion to Confucian ideals added with forced abortion techniques such as sterilization, and insertion of IUDs (Intrauterine Devices) in women drastically shifted the gender ratio of boys to girls in China; the sex ratio at birth, which is the number of male births for every 100 female births “...peaked at 121 in 2005…” (Zeng and Hesketh, 2016, “The one-child policy”, para. 6).  This caused men of marrying age to turn to violent tactics and seek bizarre ways to cope with their loneliness. A discussion paper co-authored by Edlund, Li, Yi, and Zang stated that “...a 0.01 increase in the sex ratio of the 16-25-year-old age group raised the violent and property crime rates by some 3%...” (Edulund, Li, Yi, and Zang 2007, p. 4), meaning that higher sex ratios of the number of men to the number of women associated with areas void of security.   Moreover, property crimes such as larceny, made up about 86.7 percent of all cases recorded between 1981 and 2004.  Some of the authors who collaborated on this paper represented IZA which is an independent economic research institute.  Their paper focused on deciphering the relationship between a higher sex ratio in China and criminal activity in those regions to a greater depth than Zeng and Hesketh’s research paper.  Apart from committing property crimes, some Chinese men accommodated themselves with ludicrous alternatives as sex dolls in their solitude.  A doll factory in Dongguan, China produced these dolls, and shipped them into large wooden coffins.  When asked about the quality of these sex dolls, factory owner Vincent He responded, “They really are designed to take the place of real women,” (Fong, 132).  Ironically, he proved to be correct. A university student in the Guangzhou’s university district, 24- year-old Fend Wengguang and his Kwaii Club redesigned the sex doll to fit the needs of unmarried men.  Hitdoll-the factory’s parent manufacturer- reached its sales an all-time high, amounting to ten to twelve units per month some of which Hitdoll sold to Buccone, another sex toy shop in Guangzhou, China.   Writer Mei Fong’s book “One Child: The Story of China's Most Radical Experiment” informs us about the mild experiences of people including Fong herself, with the one-child policy.  It does not make use of statistical evidence to denounce the policy as much as aforementioned sources do.   Another brutal outcome of the policy was that it traumatized women, who unless they could afford it, had little choice but to abort their second child.  Indian economist Amartya Sen coined the phrase “missing women” to refer to millions of females in Asian countries as China, either lost by sex-selective induced abortion, infanticide or abandonment.  An agency called the National Population and Family Planning Commission was in charge at the time to enforce the one-child policy in China’s many provinces.  It tasked family-planning officials with meeting a certain threshold of birth prevention through whatever means necessary. As one Sichuan County official describes, “as long as we kept the quotas, we could do anything: destroy homes, property, jail people, even threaten to confiscate people’s children, and no one would say anything.” (Fong, 72).  Families who did not comply with their protocol had to pay an exorbitant fine, which varied from location to location.  For example, Ah-Li who was a mother of four daughters and lived in China’s Guangxi province had to pay 11,000 yuan for each of her first three children. (Jian para. 7)  The fines that family-planning officials collected supposedly counted as “social compensation” fees, but according to lawyer Wu Youshui, “...the money from birth fines-no matter what they are called-was spent on office maintenance, personnel, sometimes entertainment expenses, or funneled to other departments” (Fong, 79) of the family planning commission.  In addition to penalizing their families, family planning officials also deployed police squads to carry out forced abortions.  Tubal sterilization-in which the fallopian tubes are cut or sealed to prevent the fertilization of an egg-was commonly delivered to women in China to lower their fertility.  As expected, the total fertility rate in China fell from an estimated 5.9 births per woman in 1970 to between 1.5 and 1.7 in the late 1990s (Zeng and Hesketh, 2016, “The one-child policy”, para. 1).  However, this abortion technique has been shown to be harmful to women.  A case study analyzed menstrual cycles of 500 women at Al-Zahra hospital during 1999 to 2001 to see the effect of tubal sterilization on their menstrual cycle.  Patients who took hormonal contraceptives and had worn an IUD (Intrauterine Device) for at least a year prior to the sterilization were excluded from this study.  Of the sample group of 500 women, 112 subjects were women who had undergone tubal sterilization via minilaparotomy made up case group and 288 were those who showed no trace of tubal sterilization but were still required to report their “...duration and amount of bleeding, and length of cycle (number of days from the beginning of one menstrual period to the beginning of the next one)” (cite).  Although a chi-square analysis of the data did not detect any permanent changes in the menstrual cycles among women in both groups, it did reveal that women experienced excessive blood loss after the first year of getting sterilized. In contrast to their results, DeStefano et al reported that their sample group experienced blood loss after 49-87 months of sterilization. Authors Mehir Jafari Shoberiri and Simin AtasKohli concluded that psychiatric problems may account for excessive blood loss in sterilized women and younger women are more prone to it after sterilization than older women.  Nevertheless, this study is worthwhile to mention because it acknowledges that tubal sterilizations delivered to women under the one child policy were harmful to them.   Although Zeng and Hesketh’s publication did mention that Chinese women underwent sterilization, their publication did not claim that it was by any means lethal to them. Shobeiri and AtasKohli’s publication also differs from Edlund, Li, Yi, and Zang’s publication because the former assesses the policy’s impact from a scientific standpoint and the latter based its conclusion on statistical analysis of “province-level data from China’s 26 provinces, covering the period 1988-2004” (Edlund, Li, Yi, and Zang 2007, p. 12).         Besides shifting China’s sex ratio and terrorizing women and their families, the policy also negatively impacted China’s elderly population.   For one, the pension system was poorly set up so rural households struggled to cover costs of elderly care, medical care, and burial care.  A 2013 projection of Economic Information Daily told that rural households received “73-129 RMB per person per month (US$ 11.9-21.1 USD per month)” from membership in the New Rural Old Age Insurance Program of 2009, compared to urban households and those with full-time employment, both of whom received “1,721 RMB per person per month (US$ 282 per month) on average” (Song 115).  Not to mention that rural people including the elderly, were not allowed to pursue that same opportunities as an education, settlement in the cities, or urban registration as their urban counterparts (Song 115).  Thus, Chinese elderly parents in rural households relied on their children or other family members for financial support.  This gave way to the 4:2:1 effect, in which one couple took care of their four older parents and one child (Zeng and Hesketh, 2016, “The one-child policy”, para. 8) On the other hand, Shidu parents had no living children to look up to for financial support and if they were not eligible for support and relief from the government, they could not pay their child's medical cost. (Song 115).  Moreover, health care facilities and senior care personnel were also scarce in areas where the elderly people needed them most.  For example, a shortage of beds in 2010 in senior homes “met the needs of 1.8% of the elderly population” (Song 115) and the percentage of care personnel leaving senior homes fell between 100%-140%, at the time Song published her article (Song 115).  Even worse, Shidu parents in their old age were denied access to these services, because they did not have a living child to sponsor them and earn them admission into senior homes.   Unlike previous sources, Song’s article partially discussed how the one child policy affected the lives of the elderly population, especially Shidu families.  She refers to 12 cases of Shidu families that were reported in Chinese media and uses this information to argue they were the most vulnerable group to the policy, as they not only suffered from depression but social stigma that deemed them as evil. As per my analysis on the One Child policy above, it was not a rational solution to receding China’s population boom.  Instead, it shifted the gender ratio of males to females, imposed harsh sanctions on Chinese women, and posed an immense ordeal for the elderly population of China.  It seemed that a lower fertility rate was the root of all these repercussions and to prevent further blunders, China’ government repealed it with the two-child policy in October 2015.  In “The effects of China's universal two-child policy”, Zeng and Hesketh suggest that “The population increase will be relatively small, peaking at 1.45 billion in 2029 (compared with a peak of 1.4 billion in 2023 if the one-child policy continued).” (Zeng and Hesketh, 2016, “Summary”, para. 1).  In short, the two-child policy will not bring swift socioeconomic recovery in China, but it can start to do so by increasing China’s fertility rate if more couples are not restricted to raising one child, and a need for better quality of health care given in maternal and child health services is addressed.
